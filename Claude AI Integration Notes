## Introduction to Claude

Claude is a family of AI models by Anthropic, designed for enterprise-scale applications.

### Key Capabilities and Features:
1. Text and code generation
2. Vision (image analysis and processing)
3. Tool use (interaction with external tools and functions)
4. 200K token context window
5. Multimodal input capabilities

### Model Options and Use Cases:
1. Claude 3.5 Sonnet: Balanced performance and speed for general tasks
2. Claude 3 Family:
   - Opus: Complex tasks (math, coding, in-depth analysis)
   - Sonnet: High-throughput tasks and data processing
   - Haiku: Rapid, human-like interactions (e.g., customer support)

### Enterprise Advantages:
- Security: SOC II Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliance options
- Trustworthiness: Jailbreak resistant, copyright indemnity
- Reliability: Low hallucination rates, accurate over long documents
- Global support: Strong performance in multiple languages
- Cost-effectiveness: Tiered model options for various needs
