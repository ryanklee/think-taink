## Review Process

This document should be reviewed and updated bi-weekly, coinciding with sprint planning sessions. The review process should include:

1. Assessing the status of each entry
2. Adding new entries based on recent research findings
3. Updating priorities based on current project needs
4. Identifying any entries that may no longer be relevant

## Metrics for Success

To evaluate the success of implementing these research findings, we will track the following metrics:

1. Implementation Rate: Percentage of research findings that have been successfully implemented
2. Impact Score: Subjective rating (1-10) of how much each implemented finding has improved the system
3. Time-to-Implementation: Average time between adding a research finding to this document and its successful implementation
4. User Feedback: Ratings from user testing sessions on features developed based on research findings
5. Performance Improvements: Quantitative measures of system performance before and after implementing research-based features

These metrics should be reviewed quarterly to assess the effectiveness of our research-to-implementation process.
