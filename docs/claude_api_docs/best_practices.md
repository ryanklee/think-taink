# Best Practices

## General Guidelines
1. Start with clear, specific instructions
2. Break complex tasks into smaller steps
3. Provide examples of desired output
4. Use consistent formatting and structure
5. Leverage system prompts for setting context

## API Usage
1. Implement proper error handling and retries
2. Use appropriate model for the task
3. Optimize `max_tokens` and `temperature` for your use case
4. Implement rate limiting and respect API quotas
5. Use streaming for real-time applications

## Prompt Engineering
1. Be explicit about desired output format
2. Use XML tags or markdown for structure
3. Employ chain-of-thought prompting for complex reasoning
4. Utilize few-shot learning with examples
5. Experiment with different prompting techniques

## Security and Privacy
1. Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Sanitize user inputs before sending to the API
4. Be cautious with sensitive information in prompts
5. Implement content filtering as needed

## Performance Optimization
1. Use caching for repeated queries
2. Batch requests when possible
3. Implement client-side throttling
4. Use appropriate model size for the task
5. Optimize prompt length and complexity

## Testing and Evaluation
1. Develop a comprehensive test suite
2. Use consistent evaluation metrics
3. Test with diverse inputs and edge cases
4. Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipeline
5. Regularly review and update test cases

## Monitoring and Logging
1. Implement detailed logging for API interactions
2. Monitor rate limit usage and errors
3. Track performance metrics (latency, token usage)
4. Set up alerts for unusual patterns or errors
5. Regularly review logs and metrics for optimization opportunities
