# Best Practices

## Security and Privacy
1. Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. Sanitize user inputs before sending to the API
4. Be cautious with sensitive information in prompts
5. Implement content filtering as needed

## Performance Optimization
1. Use caching for repeated queries
2. Batch requests when possible
3. Implement client-side throttling
4. Use appropriate model size for the task
5. Optimize prompt length and complexity

## Monitoring and Logging
1. Implement detailed logging for API interactions
2. Monitor rate limit usage and errors
3. Track performance metrics (latency, token usage)
4. Set up alerts for unusual patterns or errors
5. Regularly review logs and metrics for optimization opportunities
