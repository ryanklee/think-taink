# Advanced Features

## Tool Use
1. Enable Claude to use external tools or APIs
2. Implement a tool-use framework in your application
3. Define clear interfaces for tool interactions
4. Handle tool outputs and incorporate into Claude's responses

## Embeddings (Beta)
1. Generate vector representations of text
2. Use for semantic search, clustering, or recommendation systems
3. Endpoint: POST `/v1/embeddings`
4. Parameters: `model`, `input` (text to embed)

## Prompt Caching
1. Reduce API calls and improve response time
2. Cache prompts and corresponding responses
3. Implement cache invalidation strategy
4. Consider using distributed caching for scalability

## Custom Instructions
1. Use system prompts to give persistent instructions
2. Create user-specific or task-specific instruction sets
3. Dynamically update instructions based on context or user preferences

## Fine-tuning (Future Feature)
1. Customize Claude for specific tasks or domains
2. Prepare high-quality training data
3. Monitor fine-tuned model performance
4. Implement version control for fine-tuned models

## Chaining Prompts
1. Break complex tasks into a series of prompts
2. Use output from one prompt as input to the next
3. Implement error handling and recovery in chains
4. Consider using a workflow management system for complex chains

## Long-running Tasks
1. Implement asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks
2. Use webhooks or polling to notify when results are ready
3. Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Consider using a task queue system (e.g., Celery) for managing long-running tasks

## Multimodal Capabilities (Future Feature)
1. Prepare for upcoming image and audio processing features
2. Design flexible interfaces to accommodate different input types
3. Implement proper handling and storage of multimedia data
4. Consider privacy and security implications of multimedia processing
