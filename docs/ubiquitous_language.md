# Ubiquitous Language for AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed

This document defines the ubiquitous language used in our AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed. It serves as a reference for all stakeholders to ensure consistent terminology across the domain.

## Core Concepts

1. **Experiment**: A controlled study designed to observe and analyze AI agent behaviors and interactions.

2. **Agent**: An AI entity with specific traits and capabilities, participating in experiments.

3. **Trait Bundle**: A collection of behavioral characteristics that define an agent's personality and decision-making tendencies.

4. **Reasoning Engine**: The component responsible for orchestrating the collaborative reasoning process among agents.

5. **Knowledge Base**: A graph database storing concepts, relationships, and historical data relevant to experiments.

6. **Ethics Framework**: A system ensuring that all agent actions and experimental procedures adhere to predefined ethical guidelines.

7. **Experiment Runner**: A component responsible for setting up, executing, and managing experiments.

## Experiment-related Terms

8. **Experimental Protocol**: A formal description of the experiment's design, including agents, conditions, and measurement points.

9. **Control Group**: A set of agents or conditions used as a baseline for comparison in experiments.

10. **Experimental Group**: A set of agents or conditions subjected to the variable being tested in an experiment.

11. **Behavioral Metric**: A quantifiable measure of an agent's behavior or performance during an experiment.

12. **Emergent Behavior**: Complex behaviors or patterns that arise from the interactions of multiple agents, not predictable from individual agent behaviors.

## Agent-related Terms

13. **Cognitive Architecture**: The underlying structure and processes of an agent's decision-making and information processing capabilities.

14. **Trait Expression**: The manifestation of an agent's traits in its behaviors and decisions.

15. **Agent Communication Protocol**: The rules and methods by which agents exchange information during experiments.

16. **Decision Point**: A moment in an experiment where an agent must make a choice or take an action.

## Ethics and Governance

17. **Ethical Constraint**: A rule or principle that limits agent actions to ensure ethical behavior.

18. **Bias Detection**: The process of identifying unfair or skewed behaviors or outcomes in experiments.

19. **Ethical Impact Assessment**: An evaluation of the potential ethical implications of an experiment or agent behavior.

20. **Governance Model**: The framework for overseeing and regulating the conduct of experiments and the development of AI agents.

## Data and Analysis

21. **Experiment Configuration**: The complete set of parameters and settings that define an experiment's setup.

22. **Data Collection Point**: A specific moment or condition in an experiment when data is recorded.

23. **Analysis Pipeline**: The sequence of data processing and statistical analysis steps applied to experimental results.

24. **Reproducibility Protocol**: The documented process for recreating an experiment and its results.

This ubiquitous language will evolve as our understanding of the domain grows. Regular reviews and updates to this document will ensure it remains a relevant and valuable resource for all team members and stakeholders.
