# Ubiquitous Language for AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed

This document defines the ubiquitous language used in our AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed. It serves as a reference for all stakeholders to ensure consistent terminology across the domain.

## Core Domain Concepts

1. **Experiment** (Aggregate Root): A controlled study designed to observe and analyze AI agent behaviors and interactions. It encapsulates the entire lifecycle of a behavioral study.

2. **Agent** (Aggregate Root): An AI entity with specific traits and capabilities, participating in experiments. It represents an individual AI participant in the experiment.

3. **Trait Bundle** (Value Object): An immutable collection of behavioral characteristics that define an agent's personality and decision-making tendencies.

4. **Reasoning Engine** (Domain Service): The component responsible for orchestrating the collaborative reasoning process among agents.

5. **Knowledge Base** (Repository): A graph database storing concepts, relationships, and historical data relevant to experiments.

6. **Ethics Framework** (Domain Service): A system ensuring that all agent actions and experimental procedures adhere to predefined ethical guidelines.

7. **Experiment Runner** (Application Service): A component responsible for setting up, executing, and managing experiments.

## Experiment-related Terms

8. **Experimental Protocol**: A formal description of the experiment's design, including agents, conditions, and measurement points.

9. **Control Group**: A set of agents or conditions used as a baseline for comparison in experiments.

10. **Experimental Group**: A set of agents or conditions subjected to the variable being tested in an experiment.

11. **Behavioral Metric**: A quantifiable measure of an agent's behavior or performance during an experiment.

12. **Emergent Behavior**: Complex behaviors or patterns that arise from the interactions of multiple agents, not predictable from individual agent behaviors.

## Agent-related Terms

13. **Cognitive Architecture**: The underlying structure and processes of an agent's decision-making and information processing capabilities.

14. **Trait Expression**: The manifestation of an agent's traits in its behaviors and decisions.

15. **Agent Communication Protocol**: The rules and methods by which agents exchange information during experiments.

16. **Decision Point**: A moment in an experiment where an agent must make a choice or take an action.

## Ethics and Governance

17. **Ethical Constraint**: A rule or principle that limits agent actions to ensure ethical behavior.

18. **Bias Detection**: The process of identifying unfair or skewed behaviors or outcomes in experiments.

19. **Ethical Impact Assessment**: An evaluation of the potential ethical implications of an experiment or agent behavior.

20. **Governance Model**: The framework for overseeing and regulating the conduct of experiments and the development of AI agents.

## Data and Analysis

21. **Experiment Configuration** (Value Object): The complete set of parameters and settings that define an experiment's setup.

22. **Data Collection Point**: A specific moment or condition in an experiment when data is recorded.

23. **Analysis Pipeline**: The sequence of data processing and statistical analysis steps applied to experimental results.

24. **Reproducibility Protocol**: The documented process for recreating an experiment and its results.

## Domain-Driven Design Specific Terms

25. **Aggregate**: A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. In our context, Experiment and Agent are aggregates.

26. **Aggregate Root**: The entry point to an aggregate. It ensures the consistency of changes being made within the aggregate by forbidding external objects from holding references to its members.

27. **Entity**: An object fundamentally defined by its identity, rather than its attributes. Experiment and Agent are entities in our domain.

28. **Value Object**: An immutable object that describes some characteristic or attribute but carries no concept of identity. TraitBundle and ExperimentConfiguration are value objects.

29. **Domain Event**: A record of some occurrence in the domain. ExperimentStarted, ExperimentCompleted, and EthicalConcernRaised are examples of domain events.

30. **Repository**: Encapsulates the logic required to access data sources. ExperimentRepository and AgentRepository are examples in our system.

31. **Factory**: Encapsulates the logic of creating complex objects or aggregates. ExperimentFactory and AgentFactory would be responsible for creating new experiments and agents.

32. **Service**: When an operation does not conceptually belong to any object, you can implement it in a service. ReasoningEngine and EthicsFramework are examples of domain services.

This ubiquitous language will evolve as our understanding of the domain grows. Regular reviews and updates to this document will ensure it remains a relevant and valuable resource for all team members and stakeholders.
