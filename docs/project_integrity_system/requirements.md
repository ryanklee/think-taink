# Project Integrity System Requirements

1. Document Structure
   1.1. The system shall support structured documents for design axioms, domain model elements, requirements, problem statements, and research summaries.
   1.2. Each document type shall have a predefined format using YAML syntax.
   1.3. The system shall enforce consistent formatting across all document types.

2. Cross-Referencing
   2.1. The system shall support a unique identifier system for all elements (e.g., @AXIOM-001, @REQ-001).
   2.2. The system shall allow cross-referencing between different document types using these identifiers.
   2.3. The system shall validate all cross-references to ensure they point to existing elements.

3. Validation Rules
   3.1. The system shall implement and enforce the following validation rules:
     a. Every problem statement must have at least one linked research item.
     b. Every requirement must be linked to at least one problem statement.
     c. Every design axiom must be linked to at least one requirement.
     d. Every entity in the domain model must be linked to at least one requirement.
     e. Every problem statement must have at least one linked requirement.
     f. Every cited research item must be linked to at least one problem statement or requirement.
     g. Every requirement must have at least one associated test case.
     h. Every research summary must include at least one key finding and a relevance statement.
     i. Every attribute or relationship in a domain model entity must be defined.
     j. Every problem statement must be addressed by at least one design axiom.
     k. All cross-references must point to existing elements.
     l. All linked items must be from the same or compatible versions.
     m. Every experiment design must reference at least one ethical consideration.

4. Validation Process
   4.1. The system shall provide a validation script that checks all rules against the structured documents.
   4.2. The validation script shall generate a report highlighting any rule violations.
   4.3. The system shall integrate with the development pipeline to run validations automatically.

5. Reporting
   5.1. The system shall generate comprehensive reports on the project's integrity status.
   5.2. Reports shall clearly indicate which rules have passed or failed for each document.
   5.3. The system shall provide detailed error messages for any rule violations.

6. Version Control Integration
   6.1. The system shall integrate with Git for version control of all documents.
   6.2. The system shall support running integrity checks on each commit or pull request.

7. User Interface
   7.1. The system shall provide a command-line interface for running integrity checks manually.
   7.2. The system shall support generating integrity reports in both human-readable and machine-parsable formats.

8. Extensibility
   8.1. The system shall allow for easy addition of new document types and validation rules.
   8.2. The system shall provide a mechanism for customizing existing rules without modifying the core validation logic.

9. Performance
   9.1. The system shall be able to validate a project with up to 1000 documents in under 60 seconds.
   9.2. The system shall use no more than 1GB of RAM during the validation process.

10. Security
    10.1. The system shall not require or store any sensitive project information.
    10.2. The system shall run in a sandboxed environment to prevent any potential security risks.

11. Documentation
    11.1. The system shall provide comprehensive documentation on how to create and format each document type.
    11.2. The system shall include detailed explanations of all validation rules and their rationales.
    11.3. The system shall offer examples of correctly formatted documents and common error scenarios.

12. Testing Framework
    12.1. The system shall use pytest as the primary testing framework for implementing integrity checks.
    12.2. The system shall support the use of pytest fixtures for efficient test setup and data management.
    12.3. The system shall utilize pytest's parameterization features for comprehensive rule testing.
    12.4. The system shall leverage pytest's built-in reporting capabilities for clear and informative test results.
