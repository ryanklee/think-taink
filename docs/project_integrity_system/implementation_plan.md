# Project Integrity System Implementation Plan

1. Project Setup (Week 1)
   1.1. Create a new Git repository for the Project Integrity System.
   1.2. Set up a Python virtual environment for development.
   1.3. Initialize a basic project structure with directories for source code, tests, and documentation.

2. Document Structure Implementation (Week 2)
   2.1. Define YAML schemas for each document type (axioms, requirements, etc.).
   2.2. Implement Python classes to represent each document type.
   2.3. Create parsers to load YAML documents into Python objects.
   2.4. Write unit tests for document parsing and representation.

3. Cross-Referencing System (Week 3)
   3.1. Implement a unique identifier generation and validation system.
   3.2. Create a cross-reference resolver to link documents based on identifiers.
   3.3. Develop unit tests for the cross-referencing system.

4. Validation Rules Implementation (Weeks 4-5)
   4.1. Create a Rule abstract base class for defining validation rules.
   4.2. Implement concrete Rule classes for each validation rule specified in the requirements.
   4.3. Develop a RuleEngine class to manage and execute all validation rules.
   4.4. Write comprehensive unit tests for each rule and the rule engine.

5. Validation Process Development (Week 6)
   5.1. Create a main validation script that orchestrates the entire validation process.
   5.2. Implement document loading, rule execution, and result aggregation in the validation script.
   5.3. Develop integration tests for the entire validation process.

6. Reporting System (Week 7)
   6.1. Design and implement a Report class to represent validation results.
   6.2. Create formatters for generating human-readable and machine-parsable reports.
   6.3. Integrate the reporting system with the main validation script.
   6.4. Write unit tests for the reporting system.

7. Version Control Integration (Week 8)
   7.1. Develop Git hooks for running the validation script on commits and pull requests.
   7.2. Create a configuration system for specifying which hooks to use and when.
   7.3. Write documentation on how to set up and use the Git integration.

8. Command-Line Interface (Week 9)
   8.1. Design and implement a CLI using Python's argparse module.
   8.2. Create commands for running validations, generating reports, and managing configurations.
   8.3. Develop user documentation for the CLI.

9. Extensibility Features (Week 10)
   9.1. Implement a plugin system for adding new document types and validation rules.
   9.2. Create a configuration file format for customizing existing rules.
   9.3. Write developer documentation on how to extend the system.

10. Performance Optimization (Week 11)
    10.1. Conduct performance profiling of the validation process.
    10.2. Implement optimizations to meet the performance requirements.
    10.3. Create performance benchmarks and automated performance tests.

11. Security Measures (Week 12)
    11.1. Implement sandboxing for the validation process using Python's subprocess module.
    11.2. Conduct a security audit of the entire system.
    11.3. Address any identified security concerns.

12. Documentation and Examples (Week 13)
    12.1. Write comprehensive documentation for creating and formatting each document type.
    12.2. Create a user guide with examples of correctly formatted documents.
    12.3. Develop a troubleshooting guide with common error scenarios and their resolutions.

13. Testing and Quality Assurance (Week 14)
    13.1. Conduct thorough system testing with various project configurations.
    13.2. Perform code reviews and address any identified issues.
    13.3. Ensure test coverage meets or exceeds 90% for all components.

14. Deployment Preparation (Week 15)
    14.1. Create a distribution package for the Project Integrity System.
    14.2. Write installation and setup instructions for end-users.
    14.3. Prepare release notes and changelog for the initial version.

15. Project Wrap-up (Week 16)
    15.1. Conduct a final review of all deliverables against the initial requirements.
    15.2. Address any remaining issues or discrepancies.
    15.3. Prepare a project handover document and final report.

Throughout the implementation process, maintain regular communication with stakeholders and conduct weekly progress reviews. Adjust the timeline as necessary based on feedback and any unforeseen challenges.
