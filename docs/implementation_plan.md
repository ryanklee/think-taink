- [ ] Implement data sharding for improved database performance
- [ ] Conduct performance testing and optimization

## 11. Security
- [ ] Implement robust authentication and authorization system using JWT
- [ ] Conduct security audit and penetration testing
- [ ] Implement data encryption at rest and in transit
- [ ] Set up secure key management system
- [ ] Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection
- [ ] Develop security monitoring and incident response procedures

## Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All development will strictly follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) using the red-green-refactor method. This approach ensures high-quality, well-tested code and promotes a more robust and maintainable codebase.

### TDD Best Practices:

1. Write the test first: Before implementing any new feature or fixing a bug, write a failing test that defines the desired behavior.
2. Run the test to see it fail (Red): Ensure the new test fails before writing any implementation code.
3. Write the minimum amount of code to pass the test (Green): Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
4. Refactor the code: Once the test passes, refactor the code to improve its structure and readability without changing its behavior.
5. Repeat: Continue this cycle for each new feature or bug fix.
6. Keep tests small and focused: Each test should verify a single behavior or aspect of the code.
7. Maintain test independence: Tests should not depend on each other or on external factors.
8. Use descriptive test names: Name tests clearly to describe the behavior they're verifying.
9. Aim for high test coverage: Strive to cover all critical paths in the code with tests.
10. Regularly run the entire test suite: Ensure all tests pass after each change.

## Next Steps:
1. Finalize system architecture and component interactions
2. Set up development environment and CI/CD pipeline
3. Implement core "Agent" abstraction and Reasoning Engine
4. Develop Knowledge Service and set up Neo4j database
5. Create basic UI prototype with WebSocket integration
6. Implement first set of AI models and reasoning strategies
7. Develop Ethics Framework and integrate it into the reasoning process
8. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
9. Conduct first round of security auditing
10. Begin comprehensive documentation process
11. Start iterative development cycles using TDD
