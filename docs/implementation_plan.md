Progress: 10% (Initial conceptual work completed, continuing domain model refinement and documentation planning)

Note: This plan focuses on domain model refinement and documentation development. No implementation work should be started until explicitly moving to an implementation phase. The plan will be continuously updated as we refine our domain model and incorporate insights from the provided academic resources and established AI research platforms.
