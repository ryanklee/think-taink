## Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

All development will strictly follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) using the red-green-refactor method. This approach ensures high-quality, well-tested code and promotes a more robust and maintainable codebase.

### TDD Best Practices:

1. Write the test first: Before implementing any new feature or fixing a bug, write a failing test that defines the desired behavior.
2. Run the test to see it fail (Red): Ensure the new test fails before writing any implementation code.
3. Write the minimum amount of code to pass the test (Green): Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
4. Refactor the code: Once the test passes, refactor the code to improve its structure and readability without changing its behavior.
5. Repeat: Continue this cycle for each new feature or bug fix.
6. Keep tests small and focused: Each test should verify a single behavior or aspect of the code.
7. Maintain test independence: Tests should not depend on each other or on external factors.
8. Use descriptive test names: Name tests clearly to describe the behavior they're verifying.
9. Aim for high test coverage: Strive to cover all critical paths in the code with tests.
10. Regularly run the entire test suite: Ensure all tests pass after each change.
