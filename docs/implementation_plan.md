## Development Methodology: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

From this point forward, all development will strictly follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) using the red-green-refactor method. This approach ensures high-quality, well-tested code and promotes a more robust and maintainable codebase.

### TDD Best Practices:

1. Write the test first: Before implementing any new feature or fixing a bug, write a failing test that defines the desired behavior.
2. Run the test to see it fail (Red): Ensure the new test fails before writing any implementation code.
3. Write the minimum amount of code to pass the test (Green): Implement just enough code to make the test pass.
4. Refactor the code: Once the test passes, refactor the code to improve its structure and readability without changing its behavior.
5. Repeat: Continue this cycle for each new feature or bug fix.
6. Keep tests small and focused: Each test should verify a single behavior or aspect of the code.
7. Maintain test independence: Tests should not depend on each other or on external factors.
8. Use descriptive test names: Name tests clearly to describe the behavior they're verifying.
9. Aim for high test coverage: Strive to cover all critical paths in the code with tests.
10. Regularly run the entire test suite: Ensure all tests pass after each change.

## Next Steps:
1. Create Claude API documentation summary [X]
2. Complete the experimental control panel (using TDD)
3. Set up CI pipeline (integrate automated testing)
4. Conduct user acceptance testing
5. Refine based on feedback (using TDD for any changes)
6. Enhance real-time monitoring and visualization tools (using TDD)
7. Create comparative analysis tools for experimental results (using TDD)
8. Enhance UI/UX for experiment configuration and results analysis (using TDD)
9. Implement advanced versioning system for LLM pool configurations (using TDD)
10. Develop system for LLMs to generate improvement suggestions (using TDD)
11. Enhance logging and analytics to track effects of changes over time (using TDD)
