## Alignment with Problem Statements

The goals and problem statements are well-aligned, with each goal addressing one or more specific problem statements. This structure ensures that our objectives directly tackle the key challenges identified in our research. The mapping provides a clear framework for our development efforts, ensuring that each aspect of our system addresses a critical need in AI behavioral experimentation.

## Systematic Approach

1. For each goal, we will:
   a. Review and refine the corresponding problem statement(s)
   b. Identify key components in our domain model that need to be updated or created
   c. Design and implement necessary changes in our codebase
   d. Develop appropriate tests to ensure functionality
   e. Update documentation to reflect changes

2. We will prioritize goals based on their interdependencies and overall impact on the system.

3. We will regularly review and update this document to ensure our objectives and goals remain aligned with the evolving needs of AI behavioral research.

4. We will integrate feedback from stakeholders and the research community to continuously improve our testbed.

By following this structured approach, we ensure that our development efforts are directly tied to addressing the key challenges identified in our problem statements, ultimately leading to a more effective and comprehensive AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed.
