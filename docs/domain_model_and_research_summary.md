This UML class diagram represents the core domain entities, their relationships, and DDD concepts in our AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed.

### 1.2 Domain-Driven Design Concepts

- **Bounded Context**: The AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed represents a single bounded context focused on AI agent experiments.
- **Aggregates**: 
  - Experiment (root entity)
  - Agent (root entity)
- **Entities**: Experiment, Agent
- **Value Objects**: TraitBundle, ExperimentConfig, Decision, EthicalAssessment
- **Domain Events**: ExperimentStarted, ExperimentCompleted, EthicalConcernRaised
- **Repositories**: ExperimentRepository, AgentRepository, KnowledgeBase
- **Services**: ReasoningEngine, EthicsFramework, ExperimentRunner
- **Factories**: ExperimentFactory, AgentFactory (not shown in the diagram)
- **Domain Services**: ReasoningEngine, EthicsFramework

### 1.3 DDD Patterns Applied

1. **Aggregate Pattern**: Experiment and Agent are designed as aggregate roots, encapsulating related entities and value objects.
2. **Repository Pattern**: ExperimentRepository and AgentRepository provide a collection-like interface for accessing and persisting aggregates.
3. **Factory Pattern**: (Not shown in the diagram) ExperimentFactory and AgentFactory would be responsible for creating complex Experiment and Agent instances.
4. **Service Pattern**: ReasoningEngine, EthicsFramework, and ExperimentRunner are stateless services that perform domain-specific operations.
5. **Value Object Pattern**: TraitBundle is implemented as a value object, representing a collection of traits without a distinct identity.

### 1.4 Ubiquitous Language

To ensure a shared understanding across all stakeholders, we maintain a glossary of domain-specific terms in our `ubiquitous_language.md` file. This includes definitions for key concepts such as Experiment, Agent, TraitBundle, and domain-specific processes.

This system is modeled using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles to ensure a clear and consistent representation of the domain.
