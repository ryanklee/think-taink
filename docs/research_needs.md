# Research Needs for AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed

This document outlines the additional resources and documentation needed to refine our domain model and improve our system. We will update this list as resources are provided and reviewed.

## Needed Resources

1. [ ] Academic papers or books on experimental design in AI and psychology
   - Purpose: Refine our experiment design language and methodology

2. [ ] Documentation from established AI research platforms
   - Examples: OpenAI's Gym, Google's DeepMind Lab, Facebook's ParlAI
   - Purpose: Gain insights into best practices for AI experimentation platforms

3. [ ] Ethical guidelines for AI research
   - Sources: IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems, ACM Code of Ethics
   - Purpose: Enhance our ethical considerations guide

4. [ ] Technical specifications of popular trait theories in psychology
   - Examples: Five-Factor Model (Big Five), HEXACO
   - Purpose: Improve our trait bundle system

5. [ ] Data visualization libraries documentation
   - Examples: D3.js, Plotly, Bokeh
   - Purpose: Inform our visualization guide

6. [ ] Meta-analysis methodologies in behavioral sciences
   - Purpose: Develop robust meta-analysis techniques for our platform

7. [ ] Domain-specific language (DSL) design patterns
   - Purpose: Improve our experiment design language

8. [ ] Data model examples from similar research platforms
   - Purpose: Refine our data model specification

9. [ ] Documentation on scalable architectures for data-intensive applications
   - Purpose: Ensure our system design can handle large-scale experiments and data analysis

10. [ ] User guides or documentation from other behavioral experiment platforms
    - Purpose: Improve user experience design for researchers
