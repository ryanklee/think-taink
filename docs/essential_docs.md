# Essential Documentation for Collaborative AI Reasoning System

## System Overview
- Microservices-based architecture for complex AI reasoning tasks
- Facilitates collaboration between multiple AI agents
- Serves as a platform for behavioral and psychological experiments

## Core Components
1. Agent Abstraction: Fundamental unit representing an AI entity
2. Reasoning Engine: Orchestrates collaborative reasoning process
3. Knowledge Base: Graph database (Neo4j) for storing concepts, relationships, and versioned configurations
4. Ethics Framework: Ensures adherence to predefined ethical guidelines
5. User Interface: Real-time, interactive web interface
6. Experiment Runner: Facilitates complex behavioral-psychological experiments

## Key Features
- Multiple AI model integration (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
- Flexible reasoning strategies
- Real-time collaboration and visualization
