# Experiment Design Language for AI Behavioral Studies

## Overview

The Experiment Design Language (EDL) is a domain-specific language developed for specifying behavioral experiments in our AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed. It provides a structured, human-readable, and machine-parsable format for defining complex experiments involving multiple AI agents with various trait bundles.

## Language Structure

EDL is based on a YAML-like syntax for readability and ease of use. It consists of several main sections:

1. Metadata
2. Agent Definitions
3. Environment Setup
4. Experimental Conditions
5. Interaction Rules
6. Data Collection Points
7. Success Criteria

## Example Experiment Definition

```yaml
experiment:
  name: "Cooperation in Resource Allocation"
  version: "1.0"
  description: "Investigating cooperative behaviors in AI agents with varying agreeableness traits"

agents:
  - id: agent1
    trait_bundle:
      agreeableness: 0.8
      conscientiousness: 0.6
  - id: agent2
    trait_bundle:
      agreeableness: 0.2
      conscientiousness: 0.7

environment:
  resources:
    - type: "food"
      initial_amount: 100
    - type: "water"
      initial_amount: 100

conditions:
  - name: "scarcity"
    duration: 100
    resource_multiplier: 0.5
  - name: "abundance"
    duration: 100
    resource_multiplier: 2.0

interactions:
  - type: "resource_sharing"
    frequency: "per_turn"
    rules:
      - "Agents can share resources with others"
      - "Sharing incurs a small cost to the giver"

data_collection:
  - metric: "resource_distribution"
    frequency: "per_turn"
  - metric: "cooperation_events"
    frequency: "on_occurrence"
  - metric: "agent_satisfaction"
    frequency: "end_of_condition"

success_criteria:
  - "All agents survive until the end of the experiment"
  - "Resource distribution inequality below threshold"
```

## Language Features

1. **Flexible Agent Definition**: Allows for specifying any number of agents with customizable trait bundles.
2. **Dynamic Environments**: Supports definition of resources and environmental conditions that can change over time.
3. **Complex Interactions**: Enables specification of various interaction types and rules between agents.
4. **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Allows for defining multiple data collection points with varying frequencies.
5. **Clear Success Criteria**: Provides a way to specify what constitutes a successful experiment outcome.

## Implementation

The EDL will be implemented with the following components:

1. **Parser**: Converts EDL files into internal representation.
2. **Validator**: Checks for consistency and completeness of experiment definitions.
3. **Executor**: Translates EDL into executable experiment configurations.
4. **Visualization Tool**: Generates visual representations of experiment designs.

## Future Enhancements

1. Support for more complex conditional logic in interaction rules.
2. Integration with external data sources for dynamic environment updates.
3. Version control and diff tools for tracking changes in experiment designs.
4. AI-assisted experiment design suggestions based on research goals.
