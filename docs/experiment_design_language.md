# Experiment Design Language for AI Behavioral Studies

## Overview

The Experiment Design Language (EDL) is a domain-specific language developed for specifying behavioral experiments in our AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed. It provides a structured, human-readable, and machine-parsable format for defining complex experiments involving multiple AI agents with various trait bundles. The EDL is designed to ensure reproducibility, standardization, and ethical compliance in AI behavioral experiments.

## Language Structure

EDL is based on a YAML-like syntax for readability and ease of use. It consists of several main sections:

1. Metadata
2. Agent Definitions
3. Environment Setup
4. Experimental Conditions
5. Interaction Rules
6. Data Collection Points
7. Success Criteria
8. Ethical Considerations
9. Reproducibility Information
