# Implementation Plan

## 1. Setup [X]
- [X] Python 3.9+
- [X] Virtual environment
- [X] Dependencies (OpenAI, FastAPI)
- [X] Git repo
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks

## 2. Core Components [/]
- [X] Input processing
- [X] LLM pool (3-5 models)
- [X] Moderator/coordinator (expanded implementation)
- [X] Discussion flow (expanded implementation)
- [/] Heuristics & principles
  - [X] Initial set of principles and heuristics
  - [X] Reflection and improvement mechanism
  - [ ] Version control for principles and heuristics
- [X] Completion criteria (basic implementation)
- [ ] Output generation

## 3. Testing & Refinement [/]
- [/] Unit tests (expanded coverage needed)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] CI pipeline
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Refinement based on feedback

## 4. Documentation [/]
- [ ] API docs
- [X] User guide (README.md)
- [X] Contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Ethical considerations
- [ ] Inline documentation improvement

## 5. Deployment & Monitoring [/]
- [X] Logging system
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] API usage tracking

## 6. Error Handling & Logging [/]
- [X] Define custom exceptions
- [X] Implement global exception handler
- [X] Set up logging with rotation
- [ ] Create error reporting mechanism
- [/] Improve error handling in existing components

## Next Steps:
1. Continue improving error handling in remaining components
2. Expand unit test coverage, especially for the Moderator class
3. Enhance inline documentation, particularly for complex methods
4. Create version control system for principles and heuristics
5. Develop output generation system
6. Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting and type checking
7. Create API documentation
8. Address ethical considerations
9. Implement human oversight mechanism for principles and heuristics evolution
10. Develop integration tests
11. Implement more sophisticated completion criteria

Progress: 70%
