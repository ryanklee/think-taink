# Implementation Plan

## 1. Setup [X]
- [X] Python 3.9+
- [X] Virtual environment
- [X] Dependencies (OpenAI, Flask)
- [X] Git repo
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks

## 2. Core Components [/]
- [X] Input processing
- [X] LLM pool (3-5 models)
- [X] Moderator/coordinator
- [X] Discussion flow
- [X] Heuristics & principles
  - [X] Initial set of principles and heuristics
  - [X] Reflection and improvement mechanism
  - [X] Version control for principles and heuristics
- [X] Completion criteria
- [X] Output generation

## 3. Testing & Refinement [/]
- [X] Unit tests (expanded coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] CI pipeline
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Refinement based on feedback

## 4. Documentation [/]
- [ ] API docs
- [X] User guide (README.md)
- [X] Contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Ethical considerations
- [X] Inline documentation improvement

## 5. Deployment & Monitoring [/]
- [X] Logging system
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [X] API usage tracking

## 6. Error Handling & Logging [X]
- [X] Define custom exceptions
- [X] Implement global exception handler
- [X] Set up logging with rotation
- [X] Create error reporting mechanism
- [X] Improve error handling in existing components

## Next Steps:
1. Develop integration tests
2. Set up CI pipeline
3. Set up pre-commit hooks for code formatting and type checking
4. Create API documentation
5. Address ethical considerations
6. Implement human oversight mechanism for principles and heuristics evolution
7. Conduct user acceptance testing
8. Implement performance monitoring
9. Refine based on feedback

Progress: 85%
