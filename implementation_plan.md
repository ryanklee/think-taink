# Implementation Plan

## 1. Setup [X]
- [X] Python 3.9+
- [X] Virtual environment
- [X] Dependencies (OpenAI, FastAPI)
- [X] Git repo
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks

## 2. Core Components [/]
- [X] Input processing
- [X] LLM pool (3-5 models)
- [X] Moderator/coordinator (expanded implementation)
- [X] Discussion flow (expanded implementation)
- [/] Heuristics & principles
  - [X] Initial set of principles and heuristics
  - [X] Reflection and improvement mechanism
  - [ ] Version control for principles and heuristics
- [X] Completion criteria (basic implementation)
- [ ] Output generation

## 3. Testing & Refinement [/]
- [X] Unit tests (partial)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] CI pipeline
- [ ] User acceptance testing
- [ ] Refinement based on feedback

## 4. Documentation [/]
- [ ] API docs
- [X] User guide (README.md)
- [X] Contribution guidelines (CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] Ethical considerations

## 5. Deployment & Monitoring [/]
- [X] Logging system
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] API usage tracking

## 6. Error Handling & Logging [/]
- [ ] Define custom exceptions
- [X] Implement global exception handler
- [X] Set up logging with rotation
- [ ] Create error reporting mechanism

## Next Steps:
1. Complete unit tests for existing components, including the updated moderator module, principles, and reflector
2. Create version control system for principles and heuristics
3. Develop output generation system
4. Set up pre-commit hooks
5. Create API documentation
6. Address ethical considerations
7. Implement human oversight mechanism for principles and heuristics evolution
8. Implement more sophisticated completion criteria
9. Develop integration tests
10. Implement more advanced reflection and improvement mechanisms

Progress: 60%
