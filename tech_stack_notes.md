### Implementation Guide
1. Define success criteria
2. Develop test cases
3. Prompt engineering
   a. Use prompt generator for initial drafts
   b. Apply techniques: clarity, examples, chain of thought, XML tags, etc.
4. Implement Claude (API integration)
5. Test and evaluate
6. Strengthen guardrails
7. Deploy to production
8. Monitor and improve
