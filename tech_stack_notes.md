- Large context window (200K tokens for all current models)
- Multimodal input processing (text, code, images)

### Model Options
1. Claude 3.5 Family:
   - Sonnet: Most intelligent model, balancing performance with improved speed
   - Opus and Haiku: Coming later this year
2. Claude 3 Family:
   - Opus: Excels at writing and complex tasks
   - Sonnet: Balance of speed and intelligence
   - Haiku: Fast and cost-effective

### Key Capabilities
1. Text and Code Generation:
   - Summarization
   - Question answering
   - Data extraction
   - Text translation
   - Code explanation and generation
2. Vision:
   - Process and analyze visual input
   - Generate text and code from images
3. Tool Use:
   - Interact with external client-side tools and functions
   - Generate structured outputs through API calls

### Enterprise Advantages
- Security: SOC II Type 2 certified, HIPAA compliance options
- Trustworthiness: Jailbreak resistant, copyright indemnity
- Reliability: Low hallucination rates, accurate for long documents
- Global support: Strong multilingual performance
- Cost-effectiveness: Tiered model options
- Scalability: Available through Anthropic API, AWS Bedrock, and GCP Vertex AI

### Development Tools
1. Developer Console:
   - Workbench for easier, more powerful prompting in browser
   - Prompt generator tool
   - "Get Code" feature to convert Workbench sessions into integration code
2. API and SDKs:
   - RESTful API for integration
   - SDKs available for Python (3.7+) and TypeScript (4.5+)
   - API key required, can be set as an environment variable
3. Anthropic Cookbook:
   - Interactive Jupyter notebooks
   - Examples for uploading PDFs, working with embeddings, etc.
4. Prompt Library:
   - Dozens of example prompts for various use cases
5. Evaluation Tool:
   - For testing and strengthening guardrails

### Implementation Guide
1. Define success criteria
2. Develop test cases
3. Prompt engineering
   a. Use prompt generator for initial drafts
   b. Be clear, direct, and detailed in prompts
   c. Provide contextual information
   d. Use specific instructions and sequential steps
   e. Apply techniques: examples (multishot prompting), chain of thought, XML tags, etc.
4. Implement Claude (API integration)
5. Test and evaluate
6. Strengthen guardrails
7. Deploy to production
8. Monitor and improve

### Prompt Engineering Best Practices
1. Be clear and direct:
   - Treat Claude as a brilliant but new employee who needs explicit instructions
   - Provide contextual information (task purpose, audience, workflow, end goal)
   - Be specific about desired actions and output format
   - Use numbered lists or bullet points for sequential steps
2. Use examples (multishot prompting):
   - Provide clear examples of desired input and output
   - Use multiple examples for complex tasks
3. Let Claude think (Chain of Thought):
   - Encourage step-by-step reasoning for complex problems
4. Use XML tags:
   - Structure prompts and desired outputs using XML tags for clarity
5. Give Claude a role (system prompts):
   - Assign a specific role or persona to guide Claude's responses
6. Prefill Claude's response:
   - Provide a partial response structure for Claude to complete
7. Chain complex prompts:
   - Break down complex tasks into a series of smaller, manageable prompts
