# Prompt Engineering

## Key Principles
1. Be clear and specific
2. Provide context and examples
3. Use structured formats (e.g., XML tags)
4. Leverage system prompts for consistent behavior

## Techniques
1. Multi-shot prompting: Provide multiple examples
2. Chain-of-thought: Break down complex tasks
3. XML tags: Structure input and desired output
4. System prompts: Set overall context and behavior

## Best Practices
1. Start with a clear task description
2. Use examples to demonstrate desired output
3. Break complex tasks into steps
4. Specify output format explicitly
5. Encourage Claude to ask for clarification when needed

## System Prompts
- Set at the conversation level
- Define Claude's role, behavior, and constraints
- Example:
  ```
  system: You are an AI assistant specialized in Python programming. 
  Provide concise, efficient code solutions. Always include comments 
  and error handling in your code.
  ```

## Handling Long Contexts
1. Summarize key information
2. Use hierarchical structuring
3. Prioritize most relevant information
4. Leverage Claude's ability to reference earlier parts of the conversation

## Prompt Templates
- Create reusable templates for common tasks
- Use placeholders for dynamic content
- Example:
  ```
  Analyze the following {language} code for potential bugs and 
  suggest improvements:

  {code_block}

  Provide your analysis in the following format:
  1. Potential bugs
  2. Code style issues
  3. Performance improvements
  4. Suggested refactoring
  ```
