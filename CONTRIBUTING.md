# Contributing to Multi-LLM Think Tank Simulation

We value code transparency and readability. Please follow these guidelines to ensure that the codebase remains accessible and understandable to all contributors.

## Code Style and Structure

1. Follow PEP 8 guidelines for Python code style.
2. Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
3. Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
4. Use type hints for all function parameters and return values.

## Documentation

1. Write clear and concise docstrings for all classes and functions.
2. Include examples in docstrings where appropriate.
3. Use inline comments to explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions.
4. Update README files when adding new features or changing existing functionality.

## Code Comments

1. Use comments to explain the "why" behind the code, not just the "what".
2. Add section headers in large files to break the code into logical chunks.
3. Keep comments up-to-date when modifying code.

## Literate Programming

1. Consider using Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory coding and documentation.
2. Create markdown files explaining complex algorithms or system flows.

## Diagrams

1. Include architecture diagrams in the main README and component-specific READMEs.
2. Use sequence diagrams (e.g., using Mermaid) to explain complex interactions between components.

## Code Reviews

1. During code reviews, pay attention to code clarity and documentation.
2. Ask for clarification on any code that is not immediately understandable.

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a codebase that is transparent, accessible, and easy to understand for all contributors.
