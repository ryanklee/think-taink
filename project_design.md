# Multi-LLM Think Tank Simulation

## 1. Design Space

### a) LLM Pool
- Number of LLMs: 3-5
- Using GPT-3.5-turbo model with different prompts/personalities to simulate different experts
- Consider implementing a dynamic expert selection based on the input question/objective

### b) Question/Objective Input
- Simple text input system for questions or intellectual objectives
- (Future improvement: Mechanism to break down complex objectives into smaller tasks)

### c) Processing Mechanism
- Turn-based system for LLM contributions
- Separate moderator/coordinator module to manage discussion flow
- Implement a system for LLMs to ask clarifying questions to each other or the moderator
- Consider adding a mechanism for the moderator to intervene and guide the discussion if it goes off-track

### d) Heuristics and Principles
- Guiding principles: intellectual honesty, critical thinking, creativity, diversity of thought
- Scoring system for ideas based on relevance, originality, and potential impact
- Implement a system to detect and manage cognitive biases in LLM responses
- Consider adding a mechanism for fact-checking or source citation

### e) Criteria for Completion
- Time limit: maximum number of turns
- Idea saturation: no new significant ideas in the last N turns

### f) Output Generation
- Summary generation system combining most relevant and highly-scored ideas
- Include a section for dissenting opinions or alternative viewpoints
- Generate a list of potential next steps or areas for further research
- Consider implementing a system to generate visualizations of key concepts or relationships
