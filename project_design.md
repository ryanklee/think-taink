## 6. Experimental Control Panel

The experimental control panel will serve as a central interface for researchers and users to configure, run, and analyze experiments with the Multi-LLM Think Tank Simulation. It will include the following components:

### a) LLM Pool Configuration
- Interface for adding, removing, or modifying experts in the pool
- Controls for adjusting expert prompts/personalities
- Options for switching between different LLM models
- Parameter adjustment for each expert (temperature, max tokens, etc.)

### b) Heuristics and Principles Management
- Editor for viewing, modifying, and creating heuristics and principles
- Version control viewer with ability to revert to previous versions
- Weight adjustment for each principle in the evaluation process

### c) Discussion Flow Controls
- Settings for maximum number of turns, idea saturation thresholds, etc.
- Toggle for automatic moderation vs. manual intervention

### d) Experiment Setup
- Save/load functionality for different experimental configurations
- Interface for running multiple experiments in parallel
- A/B testing setup for comparing different configurations

### e) Real-time Monitoring

- Visualizations of principle application and evolution
- Performance metrics for experts and overall system

### f) Results Analysis
- Detailed breakdown of discussion flow and decision-making process
- Comparative analysis tools for different experimental runs
- Data export functionality

### g) Ethical Considerations
