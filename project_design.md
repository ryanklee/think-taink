# Multi-LLM Think Tank Simulation

## 1. Design Space

### a) LLM Pool
- Number of LLMs: 5 (Analyst, Creative, Critic, Synthesizer, Ethicist)
- Using GPT-4o-mini model with different prompts/personalities to simulate different experts
- Implemented dynamic expert pool evolution based on discussion performance

### b) Question/Objective Input
- Simple text input system for questions or intellectual objectives via web interface
- Input processing and sanitization implemented

### c) Processing Mechanism
- Turn-based system for LLM contributions
- Moderator/coordinator module manages discussion flow
- Implemented system for moderator to intervene and guide the discussion if it goes off-track

### d) Heuristics and Principles
- Initial set of guiding principles implemented
- Scoring system for ideas based on relevance, originality, and potential impact
- System for LLMs to reflect on and improve principles and heuristics
- Version control for tracking evolution of principles and heuristics implemented
- (Future improvement: Implement human oversight mechanism for approving changes to principles and heuristics)

### e) Criteria for Completion
- Time limit: maximum number of turns implemented
- (Future improvement: Implement idea saturation detection)

### f) Output Generation
- Summary generation system combining most relevant ideas implemented
- (Future improvement: Include section for dissenting opinions or alternative viewpoints)
- (Future improvement: Generate list of potential next steps or areas for further research)

## 2. Documentation and Code Transparency

- Project overview and goals (in README.md)
- System architecture (including diagrams) (partially implemented)
- LLM pool configuration
- Input processing
- Discussion flow and moderation
- Heuristics and principles
  - Initial set of principles and heuristics
  - Process for evolving principles and heuristics
  - Version history of principles and heuristics
- Completion criteria
- Output generation
- Tech stack and dependencies
- User guide (in README.md)
- Contribution guidelines (in CONTRIBUTING.md)
- Inline documentation and comments (improved)
- Type hints for all functions and classes
- (Future improvement: Create API documentation)
- (Future improvement: Address ethical considerations and guidelines)
- (Future improvement: Create architecture and sequence diagrams using Mermaid or similar tools)

## 3. Implementation Plan

## 4. Tech Stack

### a) Programming Language
- Python 3.9+

### b) LLM Integration
- OpenAI API (for GPT-4o-mini model)

### c) Backend Framework
- Flask

### d) Frontend
- Web-based interface using Flask templates

### e) Database
- JSON-based file storage for principles, heuristics, and their version history
- (Future improvement: Consider SQLite or PostgreSQL for storing discussion history and results)

### f) Version Control
- Git
- Custom version control system for principles and heuristics (implemented)

### g) Testing
- pytest for unit and integration testing

### h) Dependency Management
- pip and requirements.txt

### i) Code Quality
- (Future improvement: Implement pre-commit hooks for code formatting (black) and linting (flake8))
- (Future improvement: Use mypy for static type checking)

### j) Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- (Future improvement: Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment)

### k) Monitoring and Logging
- Implemented logging using Python's built-in logging module
- (Future improvement: Consider using Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring in production)

### l) Principles and Heuristics Management
- Custom module for managing, evolving, and versioning principles and heuristics (implemented)
