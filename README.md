# AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed

## Overview

The AI Behavioral Experiment Testbed is a sophisticated platform for conducting complex behavioral and psychological experiments with AI agents. It focuses on studying interactions between different behavioral trait bundles and provides a flexible, scalable environment for designing, executing, and analyzing experiments in AI behavior and collaboration.

## Key Features

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Unified Modeling Language (UML) approach
- Multiple AI expert roles (Analyst, Creative, Critic, Synthesizer, Ethicist)
- Flexible trait bundle system based on psychological theories
- Multi-API support for various AI models
- Turn-based discussion system with moderated conversation flow
- Dynamic expert pool evolution
- Comprehensive experiment runner for behavioral-psychological tests
- Real-time monitoring and visualization of agent interactions
- Robust ethical considerations and bias mitigation strategies

## Core Components

1. Experiment Aggregate: Represents a complete behavioral study
2. Agent Aggregate: Fundamental unit representing an AI entity
3. ReasoningEngine (Domain Service): Orchestrates collaborative reasoning
4. KnowledgeBase (Repository): Graph database for storing concepts and relationships
5. EthicsFramework (Domain Service): Ensures adherence to ethical guidelines
6. ExperimentRunner (Application Service): Facilitates complex experiments
7. TraitBundle (Value Object): Defines an agent's behavioral characteristics

## Research Focus Areas

- Cognitive Architectures for AI
- Multi-Agent Interactions
